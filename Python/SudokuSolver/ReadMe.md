### [Sudoku Solver Python File](./sudokuSolver.py)

As of now the Sudoku Solver is complete. It can take input from a comma delimited file or by user input. The user input option does not check for errors in the input given but does check length of row input. 
If it returns "No solution found" for input given then check to make sure all numbers were entered correctly and try again.
