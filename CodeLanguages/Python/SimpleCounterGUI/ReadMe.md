### [Simple GUI Python Counter File](simpleCounterGUI.py)


This is a simple GUI program designed to use a few methods of the tkinter class and some basic usage of math operations. 
When run there should be 2 windows that open. One will contain buttons with functions that are explained below. The other is strictly for showing the current count.

There are 4 functions that are tied to 4 separate buttons within the GUI window. 

Button 1 - labelled "Add 1" 
	- This button once clicked will call the onAddButtonClick function which will add 1 to the graphic counter

Button 2 - labelled "Double  Count"
	- This button once clicked will call the onDoubleButtonClick function which will double the current count and display that graphically to the user.
