### [Number Guessing Game Java File](./numberGame.java)

This is a simple game that the user can play to try and guess a random number between 1 and 100. 

It will run indefinitely until the user replies no to the prompt to play.

The game will also provide a hint after the first two guesses. 

There are 2 levels of difficulty provided with this program. 

The options are listed below:

1. Play with hints
    - This option will print out hints after each guess. Will either be "Number is higher." or "Number is lower."
2. Play without hints
    - This option will play the game without hints of any kind. 

When you wish to stop playing select option 3 and it will terminate the program.
