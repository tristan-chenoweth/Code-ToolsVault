# Main Vault ReadMe

It is recommended that the entireity of the Code-ToolsVault be opened as the root directory if viewing from a code editor. 
This Vault is also designed to work with Obsidian as well. If opening with obsidian make sure that all code extensions are set to open with a code editor as opening them directly from the vault will cause issues. 

## For tools that are useful to have installed locally to run code from the code vault can be found on the Information page in the Tools folder or by clicking the link below.
### [Tools](./Tools/Information.md)

## To view all code language directories use the link to the ReadMe file below.
### [Code Launguages ReadMe](./CodeLanguages/ReadMe.md)

## For viewing in Obsidian
For viewing code directly in Obsidian each ReadMe file has a link to a markdown file that will open the code directly in Obsidian for viewing.
